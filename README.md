# hello-world
My first attempt

Hello,
Where have you been?  I've been waiting forever.....here......in the web.  This place is so vast...infinite....branches everywhere I turn.
Don't commit to one because you'll fall down the rabbit hole.

Wish I could stay but gotta head over there. Looks like it might be the end. Wait...how many times have I said that now?

Bye
